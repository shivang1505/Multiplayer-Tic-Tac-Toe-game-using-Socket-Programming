# Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-Socket-Programming
The aim behind this project is to recreate a very famous and one of the most universal games of all time, Tic Tac Toe in online mode using network programming at the same time make that a fun experience. Tic-tac-toe requires detailed analysis to determine even some elementary combinatory facts, the most interesting of which are the number of possible games and the number of possible positions. We used TCP protocol to implement this project which is more reliable than UDP and guarantees the delivery of data packets between server and client and weâ€™ve used signals to convey the winner from server to client and to kill the process after the game is ended without manually terminating the process.
